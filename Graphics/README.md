# Graphics
- All the graphics are designed around Daydream Singapore, but you can quite easily change it
- Before you start, please download *at least* the [Figma Font Installers](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) (the app works too)
- Download the fonts in the Fonts folder (in the root of this repository)
- for macOS and Windows, just open them up, and there will be a button where you can download it
- From there, you can open up the .fig files in Figma and edit it
