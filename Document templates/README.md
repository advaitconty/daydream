# Document templates
There are 2 types of document templates included

## Fancy
These are the ones you wanna use if you are using just a PDF. The word version may look like it has a light background, but it's just like that in the preview pane.

## Print
If you're mass-printing documents, this is the one you'd want. (Unless printer ink is not your problem of course)
