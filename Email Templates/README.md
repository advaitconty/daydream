# Email Templates
These are some email templates made in good ol' HTML, cus that is what emails are these days. Also it adds a nice cool factor to it

## Generating these emails
You can use https://ddtoronto.static.domains/, created by [Dwait Pandhi on the Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U0847KFMUSC)! You'll just need to change the CDN links to your own one so it's for your specific Daydream (Headers and footers are in the graphics folder)

## Using them (Gmail only)

###### Step 1: Download the [GMass Chrome extension](https://www.gmass.co/)

###### Step 2: Authenticate GMass with your Google account

###### Step 3 and 4
